/*
Consider the below series:
1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17â€¦..
This series is a mixture of 2 series fail the odd terms in this series form a Fibonacci series and all
 the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending order
Write a program to find the Nth term in this series
The value N in a positive integer that should be read from mm. The Nth term that is calculated by the 
program should be written to STDOUT Otherthan the value of Nth term , no other characters / string or 
message should be written to STDOUT.
For example, when N:14, the 14th term in the series is 17 So only the value 17 should be printed to STDOUT
